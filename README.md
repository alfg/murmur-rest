## Murmur-rest API v1

### Overview

Murmur-REST is a RESTful web application wrapper over the Murmur SLICE API to administer virtual Mumble servers. The API allows you to develop your own application using the feature set and endpoints provided. This project was built to administer Mumble servers for [Guildbit.com](http://guildbit.com).

If you find any issues or would like to help contribute to the project, please report them via Github issues or send a pull request.

### Development Setup

* Python 3.7+ recommended

Assuming you already have Murmur running and set up, follow the instructions below to run murmur-rest
for development. Tested on Ubuntu 18.04, but should be to run wherever Murmur and Zero Ice are supported.

Runserver.py uses Flask's development server. This should be used for development only. See
Deployment for Production for running in production mode. Python `venv` is highly recommended as well.

1) Install required Zero Ice library

`sudo apt-get install python-zeroc-ice zeroc-ice-compilers`

2) Clone and install murmur-rest

```
git clone git@github.com:alfg/murmur-rest.git
cd /directory/to/murmur-rest
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note*: If running in venv, use the `--system-site-packages` flag in order to import the Ice library.

3) Set your environment variables:
```
APP_HOST=0.0.0.0
APP_PORT=8080
APP_DEBUG=True
ENABLE_AUTH=True
USERS=admin:password,admin2:password2 # Only if auth is enabled.
MURMUR_ICE_HOST=localhost
MURMUR_ICE_PORT=6502
```

4) Run and test application

```
$ python runserver.py
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080/
 * Restarting with reloader

$ curl http://localhost:8080/servers/
[
    {
        "address": ":::64739",
        "channels": 1,
        "humanize_uptime": "0:00:02",
        "id": 2,
        "log_length": 35,
        "maxusers": "10",
        "name": "",
        "running": true,
        "uptime": 2,
        "users": 0
    }
]
```


### Docker Setup

A `docker-compose` and Dockerfile are provided to easily setup a local development setup. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and run the following commands:

#### `docker-compose`
* Run docker-compose:
```
docker-compose up
```

This will start the `murmurd` and `murmur-rest` containers with the default configuration defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

Load `http://localhost:8080/servers/` into the browser to test and login with `admin/password`.

#### `docker`
* Configure `settings.py` or set environment variables:
```
APP_HOST=0.0.0.0
APP_PORT=8080
APP_DEBUG=True
ENABLE_AUTH=True
USERS=admin:password,admin2:password2
MURMUR_ICE_HOST=localhost
MURMUR_ICE_PORT=6502
```

* Pull docker image and run:
```
docker pull alfg/murmur-rest
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --rm alfg/murmur-rest
```

or

* Build and run container from source:
```
git clone https://github.com/alfg/murmur-rest
docker build -t murmur-rest .
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --rm murmur-rest
```

* Load `http://localhost:8080/servers/` into the browser to test.

#### Disabling `userland-proxy`
The userland-proxy can eat up a lot of memory, especially when using a long range of ports.
Disabling this option can reduce memory usage drastically.

Create `/etc/docker/daemon.json` and add:
```json
{
    "userland-proxy": false
}
```

Restart `dockerd`:
```
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/

### Volumes
You may want to persist your murmur database to a volume or mount your local configuration. Add to your `docker-compose`:
```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./etc/murmur.ini:/etc/murmur/murmur.ini
      - murmurdb:/var/lib/murmur/

volumes:
  murmurdb
```


###  Deployment for Production

Following the same steps for Deployment for Development, just use a Python WSGI application server
such as [Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) instead of the built-in Flask server. The provided `wsgi.py`
file is provided for this.

For example, if using Gunicorn and virtualenv:

```
/path/to/murmur-rest/env/bin/gunicorn -b 127.0.0.1:8080 wsgi:app
```
